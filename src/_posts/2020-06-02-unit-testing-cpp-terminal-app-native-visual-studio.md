### [Welcome to TheGame](#welcome-to-thegame)

To learn C++, I'm building the well known game Tic Tac Toe using Visual Studio 2019, while reading through Stroustrup's ["The C++ Programming Language (4th Edition)"](http://www.stroustrup.com/4th.html). I'm no designer, so it's a console app that runs in Terminal.

<!--more-->
The entire game (literally everything) is located in a single `.cpp` file in my VS solution called `TheGame.cpp`. I know—my creativity knows no bounds. But it's rather ugly, so I'm going to refactor the program to be object-oriented. Before making any changes, I wrote unit tests to make sure I won't break anything while refactoring.

Since `TheGame.cpp` is a console app, it seemed fitting to use Terminal to run the tests. For this, I used Visual Studio's unit testing tools `VSTest.console.exe` and the Native C++ unit test framework.

### [Setting up unit tests in Visual Studio 2019](#setting-up-unit-tests-in-visual-studio-2019)

VS 2019 ships with a native C++ Unit Test Framework, which defines a series of macros for simplified syntax. Setting up the unit tests was nice and simple—I created a separate Native Unit Test Project in my solution:

1. Right-click the solution and click `Add > New > Project`.
2. Under the `Project Type` filter, choose `Test`.
3. Select `Native Unit Test Project`, give the project a descriptive name, and click `OK`.
    
    <img alt="Creating a Unit Test Project" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2020-06-02-unit-testing/new-test-project.gif" height=400>

    When creating a separate test project in VS 2019, you need to create a reference to the project you want to test. This gives the Unit Test Project access to the project you want to test.

4. Right-click the Unit Test Project and click `Add > Reference...`
5. Check the box next to the projects to test and click `OK`.

{% include warning.html
    content="What tripped me up was forgetting to also `#include` the header files the unit tests need access to. The reference doesn't automatically give the Unit Test Project access to the `#include`d headers from the referenced project—you need to specify the ones it will need. At this stage, I didn't have any header files, so I didn't realise until later."%}

#### Deciding how to structure the Unit Test Project

When you create a Unit Test Project as described above, VS creates a template project, a `.cpp` file with example unit tests classes, unit test methods, and all the Native test framework dependencies already in place! It gave me a nice headstart and was easy to pickup how I should structure my tests. I decided to use this `.cpp` file to test only the game logic and to add `.cpp` files for other areas later.

<img alt="Structure of Unit Tests" src="{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\posts\2020-06-02-unit-testing\unit-test-structure.jpg" height=250>

Splitting up unit testing over multiple .`cpp` files allows me to run one, some, or all of my unit tests. I could also do this by creating playlists of unit tests. So if I am working in area X, I don't need to also run the unit tests for area Y, which will speed up development. In my case it'd probably only be a few seconds, but still useful.

### [Writing the unit tests](#writing-the-unit-tests)

My first goal is to refactor how `TheGame.cpp` checks for a winner, so I wrote tests for what would later be my `GameWinChecker` class. This meant also thinking about how `GameWinChecker` should work. The rules of Tic Tac Toe are simple and well defined—I only needed to translate them into C++.

#### Knowing what to test

In `TheGame.cpp`, the state of the gameboard, a.k.a. the `gameState`, is an empty STL array. As players make moves, the `gameState` fills up with their symbols. Each index corresponds to a position on the 3x3 board.

```cpp
   |   |
 0 | 1 | 2   // Horizontal winning combos:
___|___|___  // 0, 1, 2  or  3, 4, 5  or  6, 7, 8
   |   |
 3 | 4 | 5   // Vertical winning combos:
___|___|___  // 0, 3, 6  or  1, 4, 7  or  2, 5, 8
   |   |
 6 | 7 | 8   // Diagonal winning combos:
   |   |     // 0, 4, 8  or 2, 4, 6

```

In this case, it makes sense to check if a certain player's symbol (the X or O) has a winning combo in the `gameState` and return a `bool`.

The `checkIfSymbolHasWon` function takes a player symbol and the game state, and returns `true` if the symbol has won:

```cpp
const bool checkIfSymbolHasWon(char symbol, std::array<char, 9> gameState);
```

Having now defined the function, I could start writing the tests for it.

#### Covering the test cases

The first test cases covered the basic assumptions, e.g if `gameState` is full but has no winning move (i.e. a draw), `GameWinChecker` returns *false*.

```cpp
TEST_METHOD(ExpectNotWon_GameStateDraw)
{
    // Arrange
    char symbol = 'X';
    std::array<char, 9> gameState = {
        'X', 'O', 'X',
	'X', 'X', 'O',
	'O', 'X', 'O'
	};
    
    // Act
    GameWinChecker gameWinChecker;
    bool gameWon = gameWinChecker.checkIfSymbolHasWon(symbol, gameState);

    // Assert
    Assert::IsFalse(gameWon, L"More information here...");
}
```

Now it's time to put my unit tests... to the test.

### [Running the tests](#running-the-tests)

The tests currently call a function that I've haven't defined yet, so all tests should fail. Running them now will ensure any obvious logic fails will pop up before moving on to refactoring.

#### Using Visual Studio Test Explorer in the IDE
Since VS 2019 ships with the VS Test Platform, it's super simple to run unit test projects from within the IDE, the VS Console or Terminal. If you're a GUI fan, you can use Test Explorer:

<img alt="Running Tests with Test Explorer" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2020-06-02-unit-testing/test-explorer.gif" height=400>

The GUI is a great way to quickly scan and see which tests have passed or failed.

#### Using Visual Studio Test Console in Windows Terminal

I'm a Terminal fan, so I opted to run `VSTest.console.exe` in Windows Terminal. Alternatively, you can use the built in VS Command Prompt, which you can find under `Tools` in the menu bar. The end result is exactly the same, except when using the VS Command Prompt, you'll start off in a different directory than where you usually do in a fresh Terminal window. This is important, because you need to know where to find `VSTest.console.exe` to run it.

According to Microsoft's VS docs, `VSTest.console.exe` is found in the following directory:

`c:\%Program Files(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\<version>\<edition>\common7\ide\CommonExtensions\<Platform | Microsoft(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\<version>\<edition>\common7\ide\CommonExtensions\<Platform | Microsoft>`

It's a bit fiddly, but I eventually found it. To run the tests on my machine, it looked like this:

```powershell
cd '\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TestWindow'
vstest.console.exe c:\path\to\unit\tests\
```

Which resulted in this:

<img alt="Running Tests in Terminal" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2020-06-02-unit-testing/terminal.gif" height=250>

Now that the tests are doing a great job at failing, we can refactor `TheGame.cpp` to get them passing!

### [Stuff that didn't go to plan](#stuff-that-didnt-go-to-plan)

#### Linker Errors :(

I missed a crucial step when setting up the Unit Tests Project that lead to linker errors when I first went to run the tests (_LNK1165_, _LNK2005_, and _LNK2019_). I was pretty frustrated, as the errors were blocking tests from running. After googling the possible causes for (what felt like) forever, I eventually found out the issue:

The code under test is built as an `.exe` file and not a `.dll`. Which means I needed to link the separate Unit Test Project to the output object file. The code being tested doesn't export the functions that I wanted to test, so the fix was to add the output `.obj` or `.lib` file to the dependencies of the test project.

Here's how I did that:

1. Right-click the Unit Test Project.
2. Click `Properties` and in the new window click `Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies > Edit`.
3. Add the path to the `.obj` file-in my case I used `"$(SolutionDir)TheGame\$(IntDir)*.obj"`, where `TheGame` is the target project name.

### [What's next?](#whats-next)

Using the VS Test Platform in Terminal works great! But if I have to do this every time, it's going to get tedious. So my next job is to automate my unit testing using GitHub Actions before continuing with the refactor.
