A home-made Bash-based unit test framework for simple CLI programs
- Why? For Technical Programming (C++) they have us writing lots of small CLI
    programs. For some of these where it's appropriate, I use GoogleTest to
    unit test, but a lot of these are very simple and require testing error
    handling the input and the expected output.
- Only allowed to use what we've been taught, uni-applied restrictions
- Complete test coverage without breaking the rules
- put learning bash shell book to use
