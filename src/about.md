## Hey, my name is Tessa.

<img alt="Me!" src="/assets/profile-photo.png" width="200" style="float:left;vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 10px"/>
I'm a software engineer studying comp sci at VUW. We'll get along great if you
like C++, dogs, or terrible puns!

In a previous life, I worked at tech startups big and small! I worked together
with the CTO of [YR](https://thisisyr.com) to transition their development
teams (distributed across New York, San Francisco, London, Hong Kong, and
Tokyo) to Agile and improve how their teams work remotely across timezones.
I'm a Scrum Alliance Certified Product Owner, and have years of experience
working remotely and in teams.

I'm certified by the ISTQB as a Foundation level tester, and through
experience I have an appreciation for software testing and quality control;
at Teleportr I managed the release of 3 iOS apps to the App Store, and
worked with developers to introduce scripted release management into our CI/CD
pipeline! At [Tātou](https://tatou.app), I inherited a broken and manual
collection of tests that I readied to integrate into their CI/CD pipeline, too.
I also initiated Tātou's transition from Katalon to Detox for their React Native
app, and from Katalon to React Testing Library for their ReactJS Web app.

I speak English and German! I studied Mechatronics for a year while working at
[Cenit](https://cenit.com), a German firm that produces the world's leading
software for offline robotics programming and optimisation of production line
processes.

learning and working on [here](/blog/).
