## Personal Website

This is a repo for my personal website, where I post about what I'm learning
and working on. It's generated using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll),
the [Contrast](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast) template from Niklas
Buschmann, and automatically deployed via [aws Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/).

- Repo dependencies are in `Gemfile.lock` (run `bundle install` from `src`)
