vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 10px"/> I'm a software engineer specializing in computer graphics programming and fullstack web development. With expertise spanning from C++ rendering engines to modern TypeScript web applications, I enjoy tackling performance-critical challenges across the entire technology stack.

My background includes building 3D graphics systems, developing production web applications for international markets, and working with distributed teams across multiple time zones. I'm particularly drawn to projects that combine visual computing with practical software engineering.
