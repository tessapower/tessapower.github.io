<img alt="Me!" src="/images/profile-photo.png" width="200" style="float:left;
vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 10px"/> I'm a software engineer studying computer science and graphics at Victoria University of Wellington. We'll get along great if you like C++, dogs, or terrible puns!

In a previous life, I worked at tech startups big and small, and studied Mechatronics at a German University.

You can find out more about me [here](/about/), read about what I'm learning and working on [here](/blog/), and check out my projects below.
