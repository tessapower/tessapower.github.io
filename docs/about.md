## Hey, my name is Tessa.

<img alt="Me!" src="/images/profile-photo.png" width="300" style="float:right;vertical-align:middle;margin:2px 1px"/>

I'm a computer graphics software engineer. I like building things from scratch,
just to see if I can.

Want the short version? [Here's my résumé](/resume.pdf). Otherwise, read on to learn
more about me.

With over 7 years of C++ experience (4 years focused on graphics programming)
combined with 3+ years of professional experience shipping production web apps,
I bring a unique perspective to technical challenges that span from low-level
optimization to modern UIs.

My journey to graphics programming began during my year studying Mechatronics
while working at [Cenit](https://cenit.com), a company headquartered in Germany developing
industry-leading digital-twin software for offline robotics programming and
production-line optimization. This early exposure to the intersection of
graphics, mathematics, and real-world applications sparked my interest in
computer graphics and performance-critical systems.

I've built complete 3D rendering engines using DirectX 11 and OpenGL, developed
real-time mesh editing apps, a hydraulic erosion simulator, and created computer
vision tools using techniques like SIFT feature detection and RANSAC algorithms.
On the web development side, I've shipped fullstack applications using React,
TypeScript/JS, Ruby-on-Rails, and Go, with experience ranging from API design to
CI/CD pipeline implementation.

My professional experience includes enhancing the video review platform at
Shuttlerock that served creative teams across 15+ international markets. As a
Certified Scrum Product Owner and ISTQB Software Tester, I bring systematic
approaches to both product development and quality assurance.

I went back to school in 2020, and graduated in 2024 with a Computer Science
degree (3.6 GPA) from Victoria University of Wellington, where my coursework
focused heavily on computer graphics, real-time rendering, and computer vision.
I'm fluent in English and German, and have extensive experience working with
distributed teams across multiple time zones.

I'm particularly interested in roles involving shader development and low-level
rendering. Feel free to explore my [projects](/) or read about my current
learnings and dev work in my [blog](/blog).
