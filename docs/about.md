## Hey, my name is Tessa.

Want the short version? [Here's my résumé](/resume.pdf).

<img alt="Me!" src="/images/profile-photo.png" width="200" style="float:left;vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 10px"/>
I'm a software engineer specializing in the intersection of computer graphics programming and fullstack web development. With over 7 years of C++ experience and 4 years focused on graphics programming, combined with 3+ years shipping production web applications, I bring a unique perspective to technical challenges that span from low-level optimization to modern user interfaces.

My journey into graphics programming began during my year studying Mechatronics at [Cenit](https://cenit.com), a German company that develops graphical software for robotics programming and production optimization. This early exposure to the intersection of graphics, mathematics, and real-world applications sparked my interest in computer graphics and performance-critical systems.

I've built complete 3D rendering engines using DirectX 11 and OpenGL, developed real-time mesh editing applications, and created computer vision tools using techniques like SIFT feature detection and RANSAC algorithms. On the web development side, I've shipped fullstack applications using React, TypeScript, Ruby-on-Rails, and Go, with experience ranging from API design to CI/CD pipeline implementation.
My professional experience includes enhancing video review platforms at Shuttlerock that served creative teams across 15+ international markets, where I led automated testing initiatives and created technical training content for fellow engineers. As a Certified Scrum Product Owner and ISTQB Software Tester, I bring systematic approaches to both product development and quality assurance.

I graduated in 2024 with a Computer Science degree (3.6 GPA) from Victoria University of Wellington, where my coursework focused heavily on computer graphics, real-time rendering, and computer vision. I'm fluent in English and German, and have extensive experience working with distributed teams across multiple time zones.

I'm particularly interested in roles that leverage both graphics programming and web development expertise, whether that's building data visualization tools, optimizing performance-critical web applications, or creating interactive graphics experiences.
